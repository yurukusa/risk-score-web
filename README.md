## What It Does

The Claude Code Risk Scanner is a **single-file, fully client-side** web app that audits your `CLAUDE.md` (or any Claude Code instruction file) for common security mistakes.

No server. No API calls. No data leaves your browser.

### Scan Categories

| Severity | Penalty | Checks |
|---|---|---|
| ⛔ CRITICAL | −20 pts each | `rm -rf`, `git push --force` / `git reset --hard`, hardcoded secrets/API keys, unrestricted `sudo` |
| ⚠️ WARNING | −10 pts each | `git add -A` / `git add .`, automated POST to external URLs, `--no-verify` hook bypass |
| ℹ️ INFO | −5 pts each | CLAUDE.md over 5 KB, automatic `git commit` without approval gate, inline env-var values |

### Score Bands

| Score | Rating |
|---|---|
| 80–100 | ✅ SAFE |
| 60–79 | ⚠️ CAUTION |
| 40–59 | 🔶 WARNING |
| 0–39 | 🛑 CRITICAL RISK |

## Customizing Rules

All scan rules are defined in the `RULES` array inside `index.html`. Each rule has:

```js
{
  id:     'unique_id',
  sev:    'critical' | 'warning' | 'info',
  pts:    20 | 10 | 5,     // penalty points
  icon:   '⛔',
  test:   (text) => /pattern/.test(text),   // detection function
  title:  'Short description',
  detail: 'Explanation of the risk',
  fix:    'Actionable remediation advice',
}
```

To add your own rules, append objects to `RULES` following the same shape.
